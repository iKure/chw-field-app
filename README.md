# KOL Rural Health App v0.1.1
This is an application designed to aid community health workers who work with a clinic to provide care for a rural community.

## What is this made with
This is a mobile application built on [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) using the [Ionic Framework.](http://ionicframework.com) The application was bootstrapped using the [m-generator.](https://github.com/mwaylabs/generator-m) Data storage and sychnorization is done by [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) and [PouchDB.](http://pouchdb.com/) All the forms are parsed and compiled from [XLSForm.](http://xlsform.org/)

Currently this application is designed and tested for Android devices, but iOS (and other mobile devices) are our product roadmap.

If you want to install a pre-built version of this application, you will need to wait until a version is published to the Google Play Store. Until then, I suggest you get in touch with iKure.
